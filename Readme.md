# Real-Time Hand Gesture Volume Control System

## Overview

This project implements a real-time hand gesture-based volume control system using Python. By leveraging OpenCV, Mediapipe, and Pycaw, this application allows users to adjust the system volume based on hand gestures detected through a webcam. The system tracks the distance between the thumb and index finger to control the volume smoothly.

## Features

- **Hand Gesture Detection:** Utilizes Mediapipe's hand tracking model to detect and track hand landmarks in real-time.
- **Volume Control Integration:** Adjusts system volume dynamically based on the distance between the thumb and index finger using the Pycaw library.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** Displays visual feedback of detected gestures and current volume levels on the screen using OpenCV.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Mediapipe
- Pycaw
- Numpy
